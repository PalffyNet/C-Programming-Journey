C Programming – Educational Examples & Experiments
Overview

This repository contains C programming examples, exercises, and experiments created for educational purposes.
It is intended to support learning the C language fundamentals, understanding how software interacts with hardware, and building a strong foundation for systems-level programming.

The code here ranges from simple concepts to lower-level ideas that help explain how computers actually work.

Purpose

This project exists to:

Learn and practice C programming

Understand core programming fundamentals

Explore low-level and systems concepts

Bridge the gap between high-level logic and machine behavior

Serve as a reference for students, self-learners, and hobbyists

This is not a commercial project.

Educational Use & Attribution

Any code written by me is shared for educational use.

Any code, snippets, examples, or ideas not created by me:

Are clearly credited to their original authors or sources

Are included strictly for learning, study, and reference

Are not claimed as my own work

100% credit is given to original creators where applicable.

If any attribution is missing or incorrect, please open an issue and it will be fixed promptly.

Ownership & Copyright Notice

I do not claim ownership over any third-party code or referenced material.

All copyrights remain with their respective owners.

This repository exists in good faith for education, experimentation, and knowledge sharing.

What You’ll Find Here

Depending on the folder, you may see examples covering:

Variables and data types

Control flow (if, switch, loops)

Functions and scope

Arrays and strings

Pointers and memory

Structs and enums

Bitwise operations

Basic file I/O

Introductory systems concepts

Simple build and compile workflows

Code is intentionally written to be readable and instructional, not overly clever.

Requirements

To build and run the examples, you’ll need:

A C compiler such as:

gcc

clang

A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL recommended)

Most examples should compile with:

gcc file.c -o program

How to Use

Clone the repository

Navigate to an example directory

Read the source code and comments

Compile the program

Run it and experiment by modifying the code

Learning happens by breaking things and fixing them.

Disclaimer

This repository is provided as-is, with no warranty.
All code is for learning and experimentation only.

Contributions

Contributions are welcome if they:

Are educational in nature

Are clearly documented

Include proper attribution if the code is not original

Please avoid submitting:

Proprietary code

Homework solutions intended to bypass coursework rules

Why C?

C teaches concepts that many modern languages hide:

Memory management

Data representation

Performance tradeoffs

How software maps to hardware

Understanding C makes you a stronger programmer in any language.

If this repository helps you understand C a little better, then it’s doing its job.
